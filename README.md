## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

My your major learnings while working through this project are:

```html
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
```
```css
.one {
    background-image: url("images/pexels-josh-sorenson-139303.jpg");   
}
.one, .two, .three, .four{
    position: relative;
    opacity: 0.75;
    background-position: center;
    background-size: cover;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-attachment: fixed;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on front end web development technologies like html, css, bootstrap, javascript, react.js, node.js, express.js and database like mongodb etc. in future projects.
